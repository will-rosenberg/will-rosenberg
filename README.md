## Hi there 👋

- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm a multilingual mechanical engineer with my own accent coaching company, learning web development.
- 🔭 Building [Simple American Accent](https://github.com/SimpleAmericanAccent) since 2018. I help Brazilians get an American accent, if they are already advanced in English.
- ⚙️ It's a mentorship/coaching business... but I'm building my own app (and already using the MVP with clients) to make it more of a "tech-enabled service" and serve clients even better.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Currently seeking a part-time front-end web development job (10-30 hrs/wk) in parallel with my business to 1) build my skills further and 2) stabilize my income / take some financial pressure off my business.
- 🤔 Future goals: Learn more about AI, machine learning, data science, statistics, etc and use that in my business.
- 🔮 Much longer term goals: Transition beyond just American accent for Brazilians... to somehow contribute more generally to speech, language, communication, consciousness, etc. TBD. Let's solve a narrow problem first...
- 📫 How to reach me: [DM me on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/SimpleAmericanAccent)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fluent and near-native ability in Portuguese and Spanish. Obsessed with sounding like a native speaker (or as close as I can get).
