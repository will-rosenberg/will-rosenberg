## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m building [Simple American Accent](https://github.com/SimpleAmericanAccent).
- 🤔 Future goals: Learn more about AI, machine learning, data science, statistics, etc. I want to use that in my business but also I think it's a valuable long-term skill independent of my current business.
- ✈️ Former Boeing engineer turned accent coach business owner... and now getting more and more into software too. I love it.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Considering getting a job in software in parallel with my business, to invest more in that skillset (both for my business and long-term goals). One way or the other, I'm investing in software skills as I continue building my business.
- 🔮 Long term goals: make my business awesome... and transition beyond just accent for Brazilians... to somehow contribute more generally to speech, language, communication, consciousness, etc. TBD!
- 📫 How to reach me: [DM me on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/SimpleAmericanAccent)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fluent and near-native ability in Portuguese and Spanish. Obsessed with sounding like a native speaker (or as close as I can get).
