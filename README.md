  <ul>
    <li>I help Brazilians get an American accent, if they are already advanced in English.</li>
    <li>Upgrading from a service business to a tech-enabled service business.</li>
    <li>I'm building my own full stack web app and already using the MVP with clients.</li>

  <summary>👨🏻‍💻 Currently seeking a part-time front-end web development job (10-30 hrs/wk) in parallel with my business.</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Why?</li>
    <ul>  
      <li>build my skills further &</li>

  </details>

<details><summary>🔮 Future goals:</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Nearer term: Learn more about AI, machine learning, data science, statistics, etc and use that in my business.
    </li>
    <li>Much longer term: Go beyond just American accent for Brazilians... to somehow contribute more generally to speech, language, communication, consciousness, etc.
      TBD. But let's solve a narrow problem first...

  </ul>
