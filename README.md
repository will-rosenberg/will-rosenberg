Product-focused full-stack software engineer.

I built and maintain a web app (React, Node, Express, Postgres) that my accent coaching clients use.

5-minute walkthrough video and source code available [here](https://www.github.com/SimpleAmericanAccent/saa)

This software was built to support my business, Simple American Accent, where I help Brazilians who want a more American accent.

The business has served 400+ clients since 2018, and the app supports accent training, analysis, and feedback.

Before building software for my own business, I worked as a systems engineer at Boeing on large-scale aerospace systems and completed an MIT Professional Education certificate in Architecture & Systems Engineering.

That background influences how I think about tradeoffs, reliability, and real-world constraints when building software.
