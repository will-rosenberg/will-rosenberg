## Hi there 👋

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;👨🏻‍💻 I'm Will — a multilingual mechanical engineer turned accent coach and full-stack developer.

I founded **[Simple American Accent](https://www.instagram.com/SimpleAmericanAccent)** in 2018 to help Brazilians who already speak advanced English to sound more American.

      <summary>Business</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Client results:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Help 10 Brazilian clients reach a convincingly American accent (rigorous definition pending).</li>
              <li>Develop reliable, rigorous accent measurement.</li>
              <li>Show statistically and personally significant improvements in clients' accents.</li>
              <li>Improve delivery metrics (accent results, testimonials, referrals, renewals, TTV, CHS, NPS, CRR, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Financial:</strong> Hit $10k USD/month sales for 12 straight months.</li>
        </ul>

    <details>
      <summary>Software</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Near term: Become strong in JavaScript, React, and Express.</li>
          <li>Later: Explore AI/ML, data science, statistics — and use them in accent coaching.</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Life</summary>  
      <ul>
        <li>Longer term: Broaden from accent coaching to deeper work in speech, communication, or even consciousness. (First, solve a narrow problem well!)</li>
        <li>Run a marathon under 4 hours — first one took ~7.5 hours 😅</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

<details>
  <summary>⚡ Fun fact: Fluent and near-native ability in Portuguese and Spanish</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>About 20 years deep into obsessing about sounding like a native (or as close as I can get) in both languages.</li>
    <li>Born and raised in the U.S. — native speaker of American English (General American).</li>
    <li>I teach what I live — not just theory.</li>
  </ul>
