## Hi there 👋

- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm a multilingual mechanical engineer with my own accent coaching company, learning web development.
- 🔭 Building [Simple American Accent](https://github.com/SimpleAmericanAccent) since 2018.
  - I help Brazilians get an American accent, if they are already advanced in English.
  - 200k+ followers on Instagram.
  - Upgrading from a service business to a tech-enabled service business.
  - I'm building my own full stack web app and already using the MVP with clients.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Currently seeking a part-time front-end web development job (10-30 hrs/wk) in parallel with my business.
  -  Why?
      -  1) build my skills further and
      -  2) stabilize my income / take some financial pressure off my business.
  -  [Here's my portfolio.](https://www.williamrosenberg.com)
- 🔮 Future goals:
  - Nearer term: Learn more about AI, machine learning, data science, statistics, etc and use that in my business.
  - Much longer term: Go beyond just American accent for Brazilians... to somehow contribute more generally to speech, language, communication, consciousness, etc. TBD. But let's solve a narrow problem first...
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/SimpleAmericanAccent) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wrosenberg/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fluent and near-native ability in Portuguese and Spanish. Obsessed with sounding like a native speaker (or as close as I can get). Native English speaker. I teach what I live, not just theory.
