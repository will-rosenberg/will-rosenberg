        <li>Much longer term: Go beyond just American accent for Brazilians... to somehow contribute more generally to speech, language, communication, consciousness, etc. TBD. (Let's solve a narrow problem first!)</li>
        <li>Run a marathon in under 4 hours. My first was around 7.5 hours.</li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚡ Fun fact: Fluent and near-native ability in Portuguese and Spanish. I'm about 20 years deep into obsessing about sounding like a native speaker (or as close as I can get) in both of these. I'm a native speaker of American English with a so-called General American accent, but I'm pretty far from the norm when it comes to this obsession. I teach what I live, not just theory.
